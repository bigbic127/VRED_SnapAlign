# VRED-SnapAlign

This is a VRED snap script file.

I developed Snap functionality by applying some ideas. Currently, only grid snap has been added.
If you are interested in developing or have an idea, please develop it further.

It's simple to use.
Copy the script code.
Please put it on the VRED script editor and run it.

Then a new window comes out.
Click the button on the magnet picture to activate the snap function.

I also added the Align function.
Select two objects, and the second selected object is fixed and the first selected object moves.
